  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p style="border-bottom: #696969 1px inset; padding-bottom: 2%;">Construe is a web-based platform for viewing and
    annotating DICOM files. 
    <br><br>
    Tools are included for rectangular box and length measurement type annotations. The annotation 
    metadata can then be exported as a .JSON file, which is intended to be parsed and used as training input for
    deep learning models, so that algorithms can more accurately identify these regions of interest within similar
    images in the future.
    <br><br>
    You can get started by clicking the "<i>Choose DICOM Files</i>" button in the top-right corner of the screen and
    then browsing to select all of the desired DICOM files to import from your local machine. You may also drag and drop the files
    directly onto the viewer window.
  </p>

  <h1>Annotation Features</h1>
  <span class="far fa-square" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Rectangle ROI</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: R)</h4>
  <p>This button will enable the Rectangular Box Tool, which allows you to draw a box around a region of interest.
    With the tool enabled, click a point on the image to place the first corner of the box, then click again to place the opposite corner, and a
    box will be drawn for you.<br><br>
    The annotation metadata generated by this tool includes x and y coordinates for the top-left corner of the box, as well as width and
    height values for the box.
  </p>
  <br>
  <span class="fas fa-ruler-horizontal" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Length</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: L)</h4>
  <p style="border-bottom: #696969 1px inset; padding-bottom: 2%;">This button will enable the
    Length Measurement Tool, which allows you to draw a straight line on the image that includes automatically calculated length values. Simply
    click the point where you want the line to begin, then the end point, and the line will be drawn for you.
    This is useful for annotating the distance between two regions of interest, or measuring the length of any region. It may also be useful
    for annotating thin regions of interest that are not efficiently captured using the rectangular box tool.<br><br>
    The annotation metadata generated by this tool includes x and y coordinates for the start and end points of the line, as well as a numerical length value
    and a string defining the units of length.</p>
  <br>

  <h1>View Tools</h1>
  <span class="fa fa-arrows-alt" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Pan</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: P)</h4>
  <p>This button enables the Pan Tool, which allows panning around the current active image using the left mouse button. Pan is
    also possible by default by using the right mouse button while any other tool is active.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fas fa-search-plus" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Zoom</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: Z)</h4>
  <p>This button will enable the Zoom Tool, which allows you to adjust the zoom value of the current image using the left
    mouse button. With the tool chosen, click and drag along the viewer y-axis: Down to zoom in, up to zoom out.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-sun" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Windowing</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: W)</h4>
  <p>This button will enable the Windowing tool, which allows you to change the viewer's windowing 
    values using the left mouse button. With the tool chosen, click and drag along the viewer x-axis to increase
    or decrease the WW value (Window Width, also known as contrast), or along the y-axis to adjust the WL value (Window Level,
    also known as brightness).</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-adjust" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Invert</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: I)</h4>
  <p>This button will invert the image colors.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fas fa-undo" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Undo Annotation</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: U)</h4>
  <p>This button will undo any annotations created with the last used tool.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fas fa-trash-alt" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Reset Image</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: Esc)</h4>
  <p>This button resets the current image to its initial state. This includes removing all annotations, as well as
    resetting zoom, windowing, and positioning.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-backward" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Previous Image</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: Left or Up arrows)</h4>
  <p>If a multi-frame image is selected in the viewer, this button will move to the previous frame in the stack.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-forward" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Next Image</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: Right or Down arrows)</h4>
  <p>If a multi-frame image is selected in the viewer, this button will move to the next frame in the stack.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-bars" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Toggle Stack Scroll</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: S)</h4>
  <p>Clicking this button will toggle the Stack Scroll tool on/off. Stack scrolling allows for
    moving through an image stack in a multi-frame DICOM file using the mousewheel: Down for next frame,
    up for previous frame.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-play" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Play Clip</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: /)</h4>
  <p>If a multi-frame image is selected in the viewer, this button will begin looping through the frames
    at a default 10 frames per second. Click "Stop Clip" to end the loop and return to static image viewing.</p>
  <br>
  <span class="fa fa-stop" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Stop Clip</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: /)</h4>
  <p style="border-bottom: #696969 1px inset; padding-bottom: 2%;">If a multi-frame image is selected in the viewer and
    currently playing, this button will end the play loop and return you to static image viewing. </p>
      
  <br>
  <h1>Exporting</h1>
  <span class="fa fa-download" style="font-size: 20pt;"></span>
  <h4>Download Annotation Data</h4>
  <h4>(Shortcut: Alt+Enter)</h4>
  <p style="border-bottom: #696969 1px inset; padding-bottom: 2%;">This button exports all current annotations on any loaded images to a .JSON file. In the
    file, each DICOM image is represented as one JSON object containing any annotation metadata within that image as a set of key/value pairs. Therefore, the
    contents of the file is simply a list containing one of these objects for each image. See below for example JSON properties.<br><br>
    Simplified JSON example:<br><br>

  <code style="color: #C5C5C5;">{{'{'}} "width":76,<br>
    "height":25,<br>
    "left":984,<br>
    "top":353,<br>
    "uuid":"a084819e-f470-4477-af32-4a3d8a71b008",<br>
    "x":141,<br>
    "y":152,<br>
    "length":52,<br>
    "unit":"mm" {{'}'}}</code><br><br>
    
    One of these .JSON files can then later be dropped onto the viewer to restore any annotations from the file onto their respective
    images or can be shared to other team members and organizations for collaboration.</p>
